# Dinogram but Serverless

I like writing articles about dinosaurs. I made this website so I could focus more on writing dinosaur articles than on maintaining a website. 

After curating the Dinogram newsletter for a few months, I realized that I needed a way to reliably insert those newsletter editions into an external archive. Previous attempts at the Dinogram site were built with AWS EC2 and made things like DNS setup a headache. AWS Amplify has been a real life-saver for spinning up quick app projects and allowing for easier frontend prototyping.
