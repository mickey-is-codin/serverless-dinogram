## Dueling Dinosaurs Introduction

**How are you doing today?**

I'm doing alright, a day full of meetings about DD actually.

**I have no doubt, it's exciting news and I'm sure everyone wants to hear your thoughts. Could you give an overview of what's happening with the Dueling Dinosaurs fossil right now?**

Yeah, the Dueling Dinosaurs fossils are here in Raleigh, NC. They've been in Raleigh since 2017, hidden away under lock-and-key since then, until our public launch a couple Tuesdays ago. Seems forever ago. They're sitting there, waiting for us to start working on them. We're making plans now to actually start doing that now that they've been gifted to our program in the museum. Since 2017 we haven't been able to touch them, they've just been sitting in a room being kept safe. But now the museum can start working on them. Now we're making plans regarding how to prepare the fossils. Even though they're partially prepared, they're not completely prepared and there's a lot of work we need to do. So that's what we're gearing up to do currently. 

**What kind of preparation work has to occur for you and your team to start working on them?**

We know that these speciments show signs of soft tissue preservation. So before we do any mechanical removal of any matrix, we want to do some noninvasive techniques to first see if anything shows up. We want to CT Scan them at some point, we're gonna do some photogrammetry or surface scans of them, as well as some laser-stimulated florescence, which sounds really cool. We're gonna fly a camera and some lasers over the specimens, take timelapse photography, and then stitch all of those images together into one big image to see if we can get anything to show up under different wavelengths of light. So we have a whole bunch of noninvasive techniques that we want to start with first before we actually start the invasive techniques and preparation. When they were first prepared, there was a lot of super glue put on and around the specimens, just to consolidate them. So we want to try and do our best to remove that super glue because that's not a technique that is current today for archival purposes. We want to carefully remove all of that super glue as best we can so we can consolidate things a bit better.

**Is that something that was done for initial preservation?**

Basically, initial preparation was done for the set for the sale of these specimens. So even though the preparation was done relatively well, they used some techniques that we don't use today, so we want to use some more modern techniques in preparation. All of the previous techniques were done to get the specimens ready for auction.

**So this auction took place in 2017 and the fossils have been in Raleigh since then?**

The auction actually took place way back in 2010. These specimens were found in 2006, so from 2006 to 2010 was the initial preparation. Then 2010 was the auction in New York, where the specimens failed to sell. Then from 2010 to 2017 they sat in a warehouse in Montana until the then director of our museum and the director of our program, Dr. Lindsey Zanno really approached the holders of these fossils and said "let's try to get these fossils out of the private realm and into the public realm" and that's when the negotiations started. 

**Then even with sales there was a four-year delay from 2006 to 2010?**

Yeah, that delay was just the initial preparation, because they were taken out in giant, giant blocks. We have about 15 tons of Montana sitting in North Carolina, waiting for us to work on it. There was a lot of rock and bone that was taken out.

**So all of that mass has been travelling along as the fossil has gone between auction and storage?**

Yeah, so they did a little bit. They went from Montana to New York, at least pieces of them. I don't know if all blocks went to New York for the auction. But then when they did sell they went back to Montana where they just sat. But since 2017 all of the materials have been here in Raleigh. 

**I imagine that's pretty exciting for the lab there.**

It is, yeah, it's great. And it's even more great that we can finally talk about them.

### SECU DinoLab

**And the NCMNS is getting an expansion called the SECU lab?**

That's actually what my meetings were about today. We're about 90% through the development and design phase of this new space. It'll be the only expansion the museum has seen since 2012. We're taking over the first floor of one of our two buildings and putting in a state-of-the-art lab, which was graciosly sponsored by State Employees' Credit Union, hence the SECU name of the lab. The actual groundbreaking of that then will take place in 2021.

**Even that seems pretty fast considering the kind of timelines this fossil has seen up til now.**

Yep, we're excited to get this new lab space built and actually get started working on these fossils. 

**Can you tell me anything about the non-profit organization that helped purchase the fossil?**

Yeah, our museum is closely associated with Friends of the Museum and they are actually the group that raised most of the money to purchase these fossils and they graciously donated them to our program.

**What kind of development are you looking to perform on these fossils once they're actually in the SECU lab?**

One of the things that I'm excited to do is that laser-stimulated flourescence and see if we can actually see any of the soft tissues that are preserved -- see how much of a body envelope is preserved. It would be great to find a CT scanner big enough to scan whole blocks. But if that doesn't happen, then we'll be using a smaller CT machine to scan parts of these fossils. This new lab is also going to have an overhead bridge crane, which is gonna help us move these blocks around more safely instead of just wheeling them around on pallet jacks, because they are *extremely* heavy. We're gonna get a series of special microscopes that are on big boom arms which will allow us to actually get over top of these big blocks and work on them.

**What kinds of questions do you expect you'll be able to answer now with the SECU lab? Whether that's from the new SECU equipment or from the Dueling Dinosaurs fossil itself?**

These specimens preserve soft tissue impressions from parts of the body that have been unknown until now, so that really allows us to start answering questions about "what did the integument of these animals look like?". For example, the juvenile tyrannosaur has beautiful skin impressions from the foot, which is an area that we haven't had impressions from before. And then the triceratops has, what we think, is beautiful skin impressions from a part of the frill which hasn't been preserved before, so that's really great. This has been a long-standing question: "What exactly was the covering of the frill of animals like the triceratops?" 

\*Brief Zoom doggy timeout\*

Otherwise, these specimens are so well-preserved that we hope that there's also gut content in there, because they are **so** well-preserved and all of the bones are  in-life position as they would've been when the animals were alive. That tells us that they would've been buried rapidly, which gives us inklings that perhaps there is gut content in both animals. So that would be a great thing to figure out, what was their last meal? Are there pieces of the Triceratops in the juvenile Tyrannosaur, which will help us answer the quetion: "Were they really dueling or not?" Which is still a question that we don't know the answer to.

## Tyrannosaur

**You mentioned a "juvenile Tyrannosaur". Is that actually what it is? I know there's been some speculation about what exactly is buried with the Triceratops.**

Yeah, depending on who you ask, there's the group that believes in Nanotyrannus being a legitimate taxa. But recent studies have sort of directed away from that. So right now we're just calling it a Tyrannosaur. So right now it's either a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex, which if it is, will be one of the most complete Tyrannosaurus rexes ever found, which is pretty awesome. But it could also help us answer the question of whether or not Nanotyrannus is a valid taxa. 

**Seems like a pretty hot button issue in the paleo community.**

\*laughs\* Yeah you deal with a very iconic theropod, or meat-eating dinosaur, you're gonna find those hot-button topics like that. 

**Are there any questions, more broadly about theropods that this might be able to answer? Things like feathers or skin make-up?**

Yeah that's actually one of the big questions that we want to answer. So this being, what we think is a juvenile, will help us answer questions about how this animal grew up to become one of the most dominant predators of the Cretaceous. So those growth studies will help us answer those questions. As far as feathers, we don't have any evidence of that yet, but hopefully once we get into it, because one whole side of the block is covered in matrix, so hopefully we'll be able to answer things like "Was there feathers on juveniles?" "Did they have feathers only in patches?". We have evidence of Tyrannosaurs from other parts of the world -- mainly China -- that they did have a downy or feathery integument. So we want to see if that was the same for these animals here in North America. 

**You mentioned also being able to tell their gut content. It seems like the kind of questions getting answered are ones that only ever used to be pipe-dreams for paleontologists.**

Yep, absolutely. Expecially if you consider back a hundred years ago back in Barnum Brown and Sternberg times, when they were really just going out and trying to find the skulls of these animals and excavating them with dynamite. Our excavation techniques these days are **so** much better, the fidelity that we can get. We're able to just take massive chunks of rock and bring them back to wonderful spaces, like we're building in NC and then systematically go through them and look for these finer-detailed data.

**It sounds like these fossils were lucky to have been saved from the heavy hands of Marsh and the Bone Wars.**

Yeah, so they were found in the middle-of-nowhere Eastern Montana. I've been out to the quarry. The back wall that covered up these specimens is on the order or 12-15 feet above them. The way they were found was that bits of the Triceratops were weathering out at the base of this hill.

## Are Dinosaurs A Mineral?

**It sounded like some of the original difficulties of these fossils came about because of where they were found. Is that something you can speak to?**

Yeah, the fossils came from private land. There was some contention over land ownership and subservice mineral ownership from this land. So that was one of the things that held up this whole project. We had to wait for that to play out in the courts. The state of Montana unanimously decided that fossils are **not** minerals. They don't belong to mineral rights and fall under the same category as coal and diamonds. That went in our favor nicely. 

**It's fascinating that something that seems very small-scale and minutia, legally, ends up being hugely important to the field of paleontology.**

\*laughs\* It never crossed my mind until I got involved with this project. 

**So when discovering fossils are they commonly found by paleontologists, or often by private excavators looking to auction them?**

I think it's both. As paleontologists, we get permitted to go out on public lands and look. We're not allowed to go on private lands. Just because it's so muddled when trying to get agreements with the landowners. But because the areas that we're looking in Montana, much of that is private land, there are a lot of people who make deals with ranchers to go out and look for fossils on their land. It's all the same formation spread out all over, but it's been arbitrarily subdivided by these private parcels. 

**It seems like a field that draws a particular Indiana Jones-style mindset.**

Oh yeah, everybody wants to, you know, make that discovery. That's one of the things that drew me to this whole profession -- the idea of discovery and answering questions and finding new things. It makes sense that people want to go out. There's cool things there, so they want to go look.

**Do you mind giving a bit of your background and how you got into paleontology?**

I always wanted to be a paleontologist. I think I was the quintessential young kid who wants to be a paleontologist and I sort of never grew up. I just kept pursuing that particular track. By the time I got to university, at the University of Utah, I went directly into majoring in Geology. So I did my undergrad in Geology, my masters in Geology. During that time, I tried to get involved with the local museum there. They invited me to go out in the field with them and that eventually parlayed into a position as a lab manager at the Natural History Museum in Utah. Then I started my masters while continuing to work as the lab manager and sort of a field guide there as well. Then I decided that I wanted to get my PhD, so I left Utah and came out to Ohio, where I joined Dr. O'Connor's lab at Ohio University. There I got to become the lab coordinator there as well as the lab guide. From there Dr. Zanno, who I've known since 2000 and got her PhD at the University of Utah, said "Hey, I've got this project, would you be interested in coming to check it out?". And that's how I ended up in Raleigh by way of Ohio and joining Dr. Zanno in her lab. 

**Sounds like an extremely high profile, coveted role to be asked to fill.**

Absolutely. At first when she asked me I wasn't aware of the Dueling Dinosaurs fossils. But as she told me about the project and the scale of the research, I knew I couldn't pass up the opportunity. 

**So you're joining specifically to work on this set of fossils?**

Yep, I was brought on specifically to work in this lab and to manage this lab. So I'll be the SECU DinoLab manager and oversee a team of preparators as we work on these fossils. But this lab isn't just about these fossils, it's going to be a working, operating lab way into the future once this project runs its course. So maybe I'll be around that long to see that and maybe I'll move onto my next adventure before that -- we'll have to wait and see.

## Triceratops

**What kind of questions are you hoping to answer specifically about the Triceratops that was found in these fossils?**

Yeah, so there is, what we think, is preserved skin impression from parts of the frill that haven't been known before. The other thing that's really cool about this specimen is that it shows some morphological variation that's different from other Triceratops that have been found in this formation. We really want to figure out where is the boundary between intra- and inter-species variation related to this specimen. Hopefully that can tell us something about the evolution of these animals. We know that this particular specimen comes from near the base of the Hell Creek formation and as you go through time (2-3 million years) the actual Triceratops specimen transitions from *horridus* to *prorsus*. We want to figure out exactly what species this is. Is this even a Triceratops? We think it is, but is there some unknown Triceratops-like animal that hasn't been known from the Hell Creek before, which would be **awesome**. But it could just be intra-species variation. Additionally this particularly fossil shows some signs of some pathology. We definitely see from the tail blocks that this dinosaur had a broken tail at some point in its life. It lived long enough to have broken its tail and then for that injury to heal. And then there's some injuries that appear to be on their way to healing and showing some bone remodeling in other parts of the skull, which is really cool. This will help us answer questions about how this dinosaur lived, some of the injuries that it was subjected to, things like that. 

**I've been seeing a lot of discussion around whether the Triceratops skull shape was for fighting, attracting mates, or somewhere in between. Do you have an opinion on the topic or think that the Dueling Dinosaurs fossil will help us answer this question?**

Well, as far as that goes, this will give us insights into that variation. But in general, if you've got big horns, a species is going to make them into weapons. That's what they seem like they're good for. I'm sure it would make them an indominable force when you have a seven-foot skull that's waving around in the air. But if you combine that with other anatomical features from the skull, like the frill you imagine it like a shield going into battle, but it was actually very vascularized. So if you're going into battle with this feature that has all of your blood supply in it then things could get dangerous and if you get injured you risk bleeding out. So maybe not so good as a weapon. The DD fossil's skin impressions from the frill might give us a new understanding. Now that we know there wasn't a keratinous covering over the frill, that it was more reptilian like scales, that might give us an idea of how they were using that frill a bit. As far as sexual display, it seems like that could be more of a socio-sexual display. You have these beautiful horns and frill and that's there to attract mates.

## Dr. Lund

**Do you have a favorite dinosaur?**

That's an easy one for me. My favorite is *Nasutoceratops*. The reason is I was the one who found the holotype specimen in 2006. I led the team to excavate it and get it out. I did the original preparation and description on it for my Master's thesis and was on the paper to officially name it in 2013. 

**Will the SECU lab still be leading field excavations?**

Our program is a very active field program. We go out every year, mostly to the western United States. We also do some work here locally in North Carolina. This past summer we collected probably 3,000 lbs of new fossil material and brought that back to the museum. So we're planning on flushing stuff through all the time and work on new projects. Old projects will probably also be brought back in to examine with our new equipment. It's gonna be a very active lab. 

**That's astounding. I always feel like I fall into the trap of thinking that we've found everything there is to find in the fossil record and it's just not true -- there's tons of new stuff being found all the time.**

Oh yeah, that's one thing that's really great about paleontology -- everyone thinks that we know everything but we're really just scratching the surface. And as our techniques get better we're able to take a new look at old fossils that we've known for a long time and reexamine them. We can ask questions now that we never even thought we could ask before. My old lab at Ohio University just found a new species of bird in Madagascar. That fossil is only about 4cm long but what they were able to do is 3D print the fossil at a much larger scale. And now they can describe the morphology of that fossil more easily because they could do that. We plan on doing a very similar thing with the Dueling Dinosaurs fossil -- 3D print parts of them and be able to handle them much more easily than we could with the original fossils since they're still encased in these blocks. 

**Where in the world would be your ideal excavation site? Are there any specific dinosaur fossils or sites that you would love to get your hands on?**

A field locality that is actually really dear to my hear is here in the United States, it's in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument -- the Kaiparowits formation. That's where I initially started getting my experience in the field with the University of Utah. That is by far my favorite place to go work. It is just pristine and the work is hard, but it's very fulfilling to go there. Otherwise Madagascar is an amazing place to go dig fossils. The work is hard, but the fossils, people, and landscape are amazing. Additionally I would love to go to the Gobi desert and check out some of the Protoceratops fossils there. That would be amazing.
